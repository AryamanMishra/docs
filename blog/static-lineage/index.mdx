### Static, AKA "Design," Lineage is Coming Soon 

OpenLineage 1.0.0, which is expected early next month, will add support for static lineage to the project.

An initiative to add the provision of static lineage, sometimes also called "design" or "design-time" lineage, to OpenLineage came out of conversations with community members at Collibra and Manta.

Data catalogs like those offered by Collibra and Manta will benefit from static lineage support, but so will other users. In one way, this addition represents an exciting new chapter in the growth of the project. In another, it represents a return to our roots.

#### What is Static Lineage?

OpenLineage has traditionally supported only operational, or "runtime," lineage -- metadata emitted when jobs run. In other words, OpenLineage has been engineered to capture information as transformations of datasets are happening, enabling precise descriptions of those transformations.

As part of this process, OpenLineage has nonetheless also captured some static metadata -- specifically, information about jobs (such as the current version of the code) and datasets (such as the schema).

What was called for was a way to collect such static metadata outside of the run context. 

#### What Use Cases are Served by Static Lineage?

Use cases include:

- bootstrapping of a lineage graph with prospective runs for auditing
- capturing dataset ownership changes 
- consuming facets from external systems
- creating dataset symlinks more easily

#### Implementation Details 

In order to add static lineage to the spec, two new event types were proposed: `DatasetEvent` and `JobEvent`.

These new events will add facets at a point in time that will apply to an entity until a new version of the same facet is produced.
